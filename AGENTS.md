# Repository instructions

## Scope
This is the public Oyzu repository. It must be buildable and usable without private repository access or a platform account.

## Working rules
- Preserve existing user changes and inspect the worktree before editing.
- Do not publish private platform details, credentials, or customer information.
- Keep the CLI and agent headless; the desktop interface is optional.
- Account for Windows, macOS, and Linux in applicable changes.
- Do not invoke or bundle a separate mise executable.
- Keep project configuration minimal; do not introduce a programming language.
- Link significant implementation work to its agreed design and acceptance criteria. Distinguish drafts from accepted requirements.
- Do not choose a license or copy upstream code before preserving applicable notices and checking licensing.
- Add verification appropriate to the change; never claim unperformed checks passed.

## Current state
Draft visions and OEPs are indexed in docs/README.md. All current designs are draft and implementation is not started. There is no source workspace or product build/test command yet.

Run `node tooling/check-docs.mjs` for documentation structure. Do not imply this validates product behavior. Preserve agreed constraints in docs/decisions.md, distinguish proposed syntax from stable contracts, and never mark a design accepted without recorded maintainer review.
